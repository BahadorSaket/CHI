# CHI

This repository contains all material for a crowdsourced study that evaluates the effectiveness of five basic visualization types (Table, Line Chart, Bar Chart, Scatterplot, and Pie Chart) across 10 different visual analysis tasks [1], three different data attributes (Nominal, Ordinal, Numerical), and two different datasets (Cars and Movies). 


###Experiment-Software

This folder contains all the files for our online experiment. In order to run the code, you need to run a local web server and view the page. 

#####How to run a local web server?

   Step 1: install python

   Step 2: Run python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

   Step 3: Open http://localhost:8000/index.html using any web browser.
   
###Raw-Data

This folder contians data collected from the experiment. All files are in the .xls format. In order to open each of them you need to have microsoft office Excel. If not you can just open them using Google sheet.


###SPSS-Analysis

This folder contains all the analysis we ran to make sense of our data. If you have SPSS installed on your machine you can check the raw data using SPSS as well. We also provided results of the spss in pdf format. You should be able to read the results without requiring SPSS on your machine.
