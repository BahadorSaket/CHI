# Data and Task Based Effectiveness of Basic Visualizations
This repository contains all material for a crowdsourced study that evaluates the effectiveness of five basic visualization types (Table, Line Chart, Bar Chart, Scatterplot, and Pie Chart) across 10 different visual analysis tasks [1], three different data attributes (Nominal, Ordinal, Numerical), and two different datasets (Cars and Movies).
